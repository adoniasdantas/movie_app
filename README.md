# movie_app

A Flutter App that allows the user

1. To search for movies located on [TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/)
2. Save and delete the movies from favorites locally

A new Flutter project build to practice my skills on

1. Using clean architecture
2. Using TDD
3. Writing leaner code

## Getting Started

Create a file named api.dart inside the lib folder

Add two variables inside it

```
const bearerToken = 'your-bearer-token from imdb';

const initialUrlJunk = "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w200/";
```

`bearerToken` can be created using [this link](https://developer.themoviedb.org/reference/introauthentication#api-key-quick-start)

`initialUrlJunk` can be chosen according to [this link](https://developer.themoviedb.org/docs/image-basics)
